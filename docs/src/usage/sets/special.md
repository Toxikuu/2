# Special Sets

## Abstract
This page covers special sets (which were already sorta covered oops).

### Special Sets
Special sets are generated by 2 at runtime. They aren't defined by a file, but
by code. The all set (@@) is generated first, and from it, other sets.

Here they are again:
```
@@, @all       -> A set containing all packages in a repo
@a, @available -> A set containing all available packages in a repo
@i, @installed -> A set containing all installed packages in a repo
@o, @outdated  -> A set containing all outdated packages in a repo
```

### Examples
Let's see how lazy I've been about updating.
```
 $ 2 -l //@o
  main/util-linux=2.41                     ~ Outdated (2.40.4)
  main/vulkan-headers=1.4.311              ~ Outdated (1.4.310)
  main/vulkan-loader=1.4.311               ~ Outdated (1.4.310)
  tox/kernel=6.13.9                        ~ Outdated (6.13.3)
  tox/mesa=25.0.3                          ~ Outdated (25.0.1)
  tox/rust=1.85.1                          ~ Outdated (1.85.0)
  xorg/libinput=1.28.1                     ~ Outdated (1.28.0)
```
🥶

Okay, maybe I should update those. Nah, it can wait. Let's see what packages I
have in my repo as an excuse to procrastinate updates.
```
 $ 2 -l tox/@a
Packages:
  tox/llvm=20.1.2                          ~ Available
```

Actually updating all those packages would be faster than building llvm...
```
 $ 2 -u //@o
󱍷  Updating 'kernel': '6.13.3' -> '6.13.9'
󱠇  Building 'kernel=6.13.9'...
Extraction explicitly disabled
'/var/ports/tox/kernel/.build/build' -> '/usr/src/linux'
```

While that's going, let's see how many packages I have installed.
```
 $ 2 -l //@i | wc -l
334
```

I've got 333 installed packages (subtracting one line for the header above the
list).
