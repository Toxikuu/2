# Afterword

## Abstract
This page reassures the reader and functions as a transition into the later
chapters.

### That Was a Lot
Yeah. Writing documentation is hard. There's a lot of information I need to
convey now for stuff that happens later to make sense. If you're a bit
overwhelmed after all those flags, don't worry, I lowkey had to check what half
of them did again.

The later chapters have detailed usage instructions, examples, and explanations
for most of those flags, and they should (hopefully) start to make more sense.
