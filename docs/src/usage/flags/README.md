# Generic Flags

## Abstract
This page explains what some generic flags do.

### Verbose
The verbose flag (``-v`` or ``--verbose``) increases output verbosity. This
isn't really useful outside of debugging since 2 is already fairly verbose.

### Quiet
The quiet flag (``-q`` or ``--quiet``) decreases output verbosity. This can be
very nice when building multiple packages as it suppresses build output.

### Force
The force flag (``-f`` or ``--force``) performs certain actions more forcibly.
It has unique interactions depending on what other flags it is combined with.

### Version
The version flag (``-V`` or ``--version``) displays 2's version.

### Help
The help flag (``-h`` or ``--help``) displays basic usage information and links
to this documentation.
