# Standards

## Abstract
This page defines standards and conventions used throughout this book.

### Abstracts
Every page starts with an abstract that briefly sums up what the page is about.
I included these because sometimes you wanna know what the page talks about but
you can't be assed to skim through it to see if it's what you're looking for.
Abstracts are a godsend when researching, so hopefully they're of use here. I
try to keep them shorter than a paragraph.

### Tone/POV/Tense/Grammar
**Tone:** As you've likely caught on, this isn't very formal. I'm going for a
one-sided conversation.

**POV:** Tying into the conversational bit, this book is written in mostly the
1st and 2nd points of view.

**Tense:** The tense probably shifts fairly often, my bad.

**Grammar:** I'll use contractions and informalities like 'wanna' every now and
then, but overall, I'm trying to keep things grammatically correct. However, if
something's clearer when grammatically incorrect, I prefer clarity (for
instance, using a dependent clause as a sentence to emphasize pauses).

### Code Blocks
Snips are shown as a ``...``.

Command code blocks don't use any syntax highlighting. Commands start with `` $
`` for a regular user and `` # `` for the root user. Lines with neither are for
displaying stdout and stderr.

Other code blocks may have syntax highlighting.

### Errata
I'm tryna follow my standards, so if I fuck up, kindly let me know. Or unkindly
let me know; I don't mind.

If you spot a typo, something egregiously unclear, something that could be
reworded to be much simpler, or a grammatical error, please
[make a documentation issue](https://github.com/Toxikuu/2/issues/new?assignees=Toxikuu&labels=Documentation&projects=&template=docs.md&title=%5BDOC%5D%20%3CBrief%20Description%3E)
and/or submit a PR.

If you notice something factually incorrect or outdated, use
[this link](https://github.com/Toxikuu/2/issues/new?assignees=Toxikuu&labels=Factually%20Incorrect,Documentation&projects=&template=docs.md&title=%5BDOC%5D%20%3CBrief%20Description%3E)
to make an issue instead.

### Formatting
This bit's not really useful if you're reading this as HTML, which you probably
are. So ignore this unless you're contributing.

The markdown documents should wrap at 80 characters, with the exception of
links and code blocks, which shouldn't be split.
