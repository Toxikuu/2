# Introduction

## Abstract
This page serves as a lighthearted introduction to 2.

## Welcome
Hi, welcome to the 2 documentation! I'm going to do my best to explain how 2
works, and how to use it, all while trying not to bore you to death.

## Organization
This documentation is organized sorta like a book. I've split it into a few
(hopefully sensible) chapters. Fair warning, the hardest learning curve is at
the start, but you don't have to understand all the stuff from the beginning,
as it's built on throughout the book.

## Rationale
If you know, you know. (Yes, I'm gatekeeping the rationale from you to keep you
reading. It should make sense as you read, otherwise I'm a shitty author.)

## Call to Action
Go on then, read! Here's a quote from hit platformer Celeste for encouragement:
