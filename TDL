# Project: two

TODO
  
    Figure out how to make documentation not show in --help as it currently does

    Add log4rs or tracing integration (ideally only log to a file)

WIP

    Add syncing

    Add repo addition

    documentation

    Expand the main repo

DONEISH

    Add repo priority and auto_ambiguity

    Fix sourceless package support
        Done; needs testing though

    Make file size update dynamically for unknown sizes

    make the scripts recognize $EDITOR

    Check if the necessary dot dirs exist for the passed package, and create them
        Would ensure cleaning works properly on first builds

    Remove all references to /code

    Fix bugs in install.sh
        Rustup toolchain handling
        no op for the currently nonexistent wget command
        fix /bin/2

    Check whether another package is installed before checking against its manifest when removing a specific package

    Fix set ambiguity

    Update the README

    Add an install.sh

    Migrate to using $D

    Add an option to exclude paths from the extraction

    actually implement pruning

    check source hashes during the setup stage

    Migrate build to /usr/ports/<repo>/<package>/.build

    Migrate sources to /usr/ports/<repo>/<package>/.sources

    Prefer ambiguity checks over verbose repo specification

    Add listing functionality

    Test package installation

    Add manifest checking and logic for package removal

    Add source fetching

IDEAS

    Consider writing to a .part to avoid the possibility of incomplete tarballs because of an interrupted download

    Rayon everywhere
