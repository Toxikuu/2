# 2

## Info
2 is a source-based package manager for LFS. It packages packages into distribution tarballs (with zstd compression), allowing for rapid reinstalls, while not compromising on the perks of low-level build-process control. It uses /usr/ports to store package repositories, which contain build-information for individual packages.

## Installation
2 is not yet ready for use. An install script is ✨ coming soon™✨.
